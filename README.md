# Minor explorations with US presidential inaugural speeches

On February 28, 2017 the Digital Approaches Reading Group at
Washington University in St. Louis, led by humanities graduate
students, organized a meeting at which participants would report back
on preliminary explorations with a common data set. They proposed
looking at US presidential inaugural speeches, and distributed a file that extended Alan Liu's compilation distributed at his [DH Toychest](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244469/Data%20Collections%20and%20Datasets)

Here are a few bits and pieces of exploration. 

TF-IDF.ipynb is a Python3 [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) that demonstrates how [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) (explained in the notebook) can be calculated step-by-step with Pandas dataframes.

explore_inaugurals.ipynb is an open-ended Python notebook exploration of a few segments of the term and document frequency ranges of the inaugural corpus as a whole, primarily through word lists.

jstfidf is a freestanding interactive browser visualization of the term and document frequencies distributions of each inaugural in succession. Instead of assigning a TF-IDF score to each term, it's intended to clarify how term frequency and document count are independent dimensions, and invite a little exploration of more corners of vocabulary than TF-IDF scores alone tend to bring to the fore.
